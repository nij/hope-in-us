    The global health crisis has caused considerable upheaval in the cultural
    and adult education sectors, as their actors, often accustomed to working
    collectively and with the public, have found themselves isolated behind
    their doors or their computers.

    How can these two sectors and their actors be resilient in the face of the crisis and, more generally, in the face of a world in which the digital world is becoming increasingly dominant?

    It is to this vast question that the partners of Hope in Us have decided to provide some answers.

    For us, this global health crisis is an opportunity to enter into a process of resilience and hope, taking care of ourselves and others, building with others and for all, where the experiences of some will enrich those of others.

    This is the challenge that we wanted to take up by creating a digital community, conceived in the principle of third places. These are spaces where different publics meet and where one can share, work, contribute, train and exchange.

    In addition to the third places that exist in many European territories, HOPE in US aims to create a virtual third place in which all European actors and citizens can be contributors and/or beneficiaries. In this online place, we want to make available multiple tools, methods, testimonies to allow the arts and culture sector to invent new modalities of creation, dissemination, mediation and to the adult and youth training sector to go beyond the logic of learning to invent more interactive pedagogical formats.

  intro: "The project partners want to develop the capacity of the target groups
    to make sense of their actions, to become responsible for what they can
    change and to be resilient to what they cannot avoid.  To achieve this, two
    innovative educational resources will be developed:"

    ### A toolbox


    The need to master and grow in the digital space is an unavoidable priority today.

    The toolbox allows for experimentation and learning to be resilient as well as training and to learn and use digital technology. Each user can use all or part of the proposed tools to meet their own needs or the needs of the groups they support. It is designed to be used in a hybrid environment, i.e. both on site and virtually.

    The tools selected for this toolkit are divided into 4 main themes themes that we have chosen: 


    \- Teach and Learn #education


    \- Explore the world of work #jobsearch


    \- Empower yourself #empowerment


    \- Be happy #behappy
