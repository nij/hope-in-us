  title: The Web TV
  intro: >-
    At a time when video has taken on major importance on the Internet, creating
    a Web TV is an effective way to promote projects, innovations and
    experiences.

    It is a playful tool that allows us to communicate with all the actors of the Hope in Us community. 

    We have created 5 programmes which are all hosted on Youtube and accessible in several languages.

    You in turn can use these programmes as an educational tool, but also enrich them or create new ones. You will find all the instructions for the filming.
